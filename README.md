# Implementation of Olaf-Neighbourhood Protocol for Tutorial 7

- Code server in Python
- Code client in C/C++

We need to come to some consensus on what parameters to use.

Use a makefile for compiling.

Feel free to modify this code to implement you're vulnerabilties. As far as I am aware we will need to code the frontend of our applications and agree on some methodology of communication.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev && sudo apt-get install libssl-dev && sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev


git clone https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp.git

cd websocketpp

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

sudo make install
```
